## [Show Results in Tab Title](https://github.com/Graywing13/amq-scripts/blob/main/showResultsInTitle.user.js)

For anyone else who tabs out a lot -- this shows answer results in the tab title, so u dont have to tab back in to check answers.

## [Different backgrounds for chat and game](https://github.com/Graywing13/amq-scripts/blob/main/diffBkgForChatAndGame.user.js)
Lets u pick different images for the in-game bkg and chat. Compatible with Elodie's scripts.

By default the chat is merely darkened, but you can pick a gradient of colours (like the image below) if you prefer.
